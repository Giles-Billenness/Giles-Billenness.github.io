            bookings with a local cinema, and we hosted the chatbot using a custom web service.
            We did this project in Python, SpaCy, and flask. During this project, I developed my

            claim, using their vehicle history and personal attributes to aid in the decision of approving
            them for insurance.
            Our team experimented with and evaluated various data modelling techniques such as
            Boosted decision trees, Random forest decision trees, Multi-layer perceptron, and Deep
            neural networks and their performance on our data. This project was done in R using
            large-scale real car insurance data provided on Kaggle. During this project, I developed my

            using this genetic algorithm for training a feed-forward multi-layer perceptron network to
            approximate a function. This project was done in python using the Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python (DEAP) framework.
